Instructions: Open the index.html file in your browser and the game board will display with the game running. 

To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player around. If you move out of bounds, your character will go back to the starting position and your score will remain uneffected.

The goal of the game is to reach the water without being hit by the bugs and you will gain 1 point for each successful crossing. Colliding with a bug will cause you to lose a point and your player character will go back to the starting position.
